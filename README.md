# Cardio Deseases Prediction
In this project, I implement a complex and in-depth analysis on ECG signal processing, from a public database that can be obtained at physionet.org. In it, I show how to filter the signals of interest, what optimal preprocessing is needed, and I implement 2 AI approaches. One is applying a convolutional network to the signals, and another is applying a prediction model on tabular data, calculated characteristics of each beat from the previously designed beat detector. Finally, I include an interface to be able to visualize these signals and be able to analyze each beat individually. I hope it helps you, if you have any questions, do not hesitate to write to my linkedin profile :)
